#AristoCards

This is a complete remake of the original AristoCards.
At its core, it is just a game of blackjack.
This time, there are no asterisks, so everything is working properly.

First, the landing page is a leaderboard and a login.
Enter whatever username you would like, then click submit.
Click the Play button, and it will take you to the betting page.
Enter a bet amount, then deal.
Your cards and the dealer's cards are displayed, and you can hover over your cards that are not shown to see them.
Based on your score and the dealer's score, you can either hit or stand.
After either standing or busting, the dealer will take its turn all cards will be revealed.
Click the Next button to return to betting.

If you don't know how blackjack works, look it up, it's really that simple.
Try to get the highest score, for the highest score will earn my best regards.
